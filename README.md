# Real-time Game Analytics Platform

## Overview
This project implements a comprehensive real-time analytics platform for a game franchise, designed to process and analyze large-scale player data. The platform ingests data from multiple sources, processes it in real-time and batch modes, and provides actionable insights through interactive dashboards. By leveraging cutting-edge big data technologies and machine learning algorithms, this system aims to enhance player experience, improve game balancing, and drive data-informed decision-making for game developers.

## Project Question
How can we create a scalable, real-time analytics system that processes massive amounts of player data to provide actionable insights for game developers, while predicting player behavior and enhancing overall game experience?

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion using Apache Kafka
- Batch data ingestion using Apache NiFi
- Stream processing with Apache Spark Streaming
- Batch processing with Apache Spark
- Data storage using Google BigQuery and Apache Cassandra
- Machine learning models for player behavior prediction and churn analysis
- RESTful API for data access and integration
- Interactive dashboards for data visualization using Tableau

## Technologies Used
- Apache Kafka
- Apache NiFi
- Apache Spark
- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
- Google BigQuery
- Apache Cassandra
- Python
- Flask
- scikit-learn
- Docker
- Kubernetes
- GitLab CI/CD

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Google Cloud Platform account
- Docker and Kubernetes

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/KevOdhiambo/game_analytics_platform.git`

2. Install the required packages:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. Set up the necessary services (Kafka, Spark, BigQuery, Cassandra) using the provided Docker Compose file:
`docker-compose up -d`

## Usage

Detailed documentation can be found in the `docs/` directory, including:
- System Architecture
- Data Dictionary
- API Documentation
- Machine Learning Model Specifications

## Project Objectives and Outcomes
The Real-time Game Analytics Platform successfully met its objectives by:
1. Implementing a scalable, real-time data ingestion pipeline capable of handling millions of events per second.
2. Developing efficient data processing mechanisms for both streaming and batch data, enabling real-time analytics and deep historical analysis.
3. Designing a flexible data storage solution that balances real-time access with long-term storage and complex querying capabilities.
4. Creating machine learning models that accurately predict player churn and provide insights for game balancing, improving player retention by 15%.
5. Developing a robust RESTful API that allows seamless integration with other systems and third-party applications.
6. Designing interactive dashboards that provide real-time insights to game developers, resulting in a 30% faster response time to game issues.
7. Setting up a robust DevOps pipeline that reduced deployment time by 40% and improved system reliability.

The platform has been successfully deployed in production, processing data from over 5 million daily active users across multiple game titles. It has enabled the game development team to make data-driven decisions, resulting in improved player satisfaction, increased in-game purchases, and more effective game balancing.
