# System Architecture

## Overview
The Game Analytics Platform is designed as a scalable, distributed system capable of processing large volumes of real-time and historical game data. The architecture follows a microservices approach, with each component responsible for a specific function in the data pipeline.

## Components

1. Data Ingestion
   - Apache Kafka: Handles real-time data streaming
   - Apache NiFi: Manages batch data ingestion

2. Data Processing
   - Apache Spark Streaming: Processes real-time data streams
   - Apache Spark Batch: Handles historical data analysis

3. Data Storage
   - Google BigQuery: Data warehouse for long-term storage and complex queries
   - Apache Cassandra: NoSQL database for real-time data access

4. Data Analysis
   - Python scripts: For data cleaning and transformation
   - Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development

5. API Layer
   - Flask: Provides RESTful API endpoints

6. Visualization
   - Tableau: Creates interactive dashboards

7. Infrastructure
   - Google Cloud Platform: Hosts the entire system
   - Docker: Ensures consistent development and deployment environments
   - Kubernetes: Orchestrates containerized applications

## Data Flow

1. Game events are ingested in real-time through Kafka and in batches through NiFi.
2. Spark Streaming processes the real-time data and stores it in Cassandra for immediate access.
3. Batch data is processed by Spark and stored in BigQuery for long-term analysis.
4. Machine learning models are trained on historical data and deployed for real-time predictions.
5. The Flask API exposes processed data and ML model results.
6. Tableau dashboards visualize the data and insights.

## Scalability and Fault Tolerance

- Kafka and Cassandra are distributed systems that can scale horizontally.
- Spark can dynamically allocate resources based on workload.
- Kubernetes ensures high availability and automatic scaling of application components.
- GCP provides managed services with built-in redundancy and failover mechanisms.
